### Reusing as a template

Anyone is welcome to re-use this résumé as a template for their own.

The best way to modify the contents is to fork this repo and go through the source code of `index.html` line by line to edit as you see fit.

The **layout and styles** are based on [Bootstrap v.4](https://getbootstrap.com/). I merged their blog and gallery examples with some of my own ideas.

I used some **commercial icons** from [FontAwesome Pro](https://fontawesome.com/). They require a paid subscription. You can opt out by using their free styles and designs. I find the Pro version more elegant and well worth the money.

### Print or PDF versions

Google Chrome prints a better version than FireFox, but neither is good enough when printed or saved as PDF.
Append `?prn` to the URL to produce a simplified, single page version with a link to the full version on GitHub. E.g. http://cv.onebro.me/?prn.
